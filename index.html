	<h2 id="a">DESCRIPTION</h2>
	<p>AIChE and the Young Professionals Committee (YPC), with support from the AIChE Foundation, 
	are recognizing these 35 outstanding young professional AIChE members with the AIChE 35 Under 35 Award 
	because they have made significant contributions to the Institute and to the chemical engineering profession.
	The award was created to acknowledge the successes of some of AIChE’s youngest members, all under the age of
	 35, and to promote the achievements of this generation of chemical engineers who are changing the face of
	 the profession. The winners exemplify the best our profession has to offer and represent the full breadth 
	of early ChE career paths. Each award winner was selected for their achievements in one of seven categories: 
	bioengineering, chemicals, education, energy, innovation, leadership, and safety.
	In addition to this feature, the awardees will be highlighted on the ChEnected blog 
	and on AIChE’s social media outlets with the hashtag #AIChE35Under35. An awards reception 
	at the 2017 AIChE Annual Meeting in Minneapolis, MN (Oct. 29–Nov. 3, 2017) will also celebrate the winners.</p>
